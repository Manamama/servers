# Clearing Up the Documentation Mess Task

**Goal:** The primary goal of this task is to systematically review, update, and organize the documentation files within the `/home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/gemini-cli/Temp_Projects/servers_forked` directory. This involves ensuring that each document accurately reflects the current status of the related projects and is appropriately named and located.

**Current Status Quo:**

*   **Memory Server Debugging Plan:** The file originally named `memory_restart_plan.md` has been updated to reflect that the memory server debugging issue is resolved. It has been renamed to `memory_server_debug_resolved.md` and moved to `/home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/gemini-cli/Temp_Projects/servers_forked/Fork_Updates/Solved/`.
*   **Sequential Thinking Tool Proposals:** The file originally named `comment_edit.md` has been updated to reflect the current status and successful implementation of Grok AI's `sequentialthinking` tool proposals. It has been renamed to `sequential_thinking_tool_proposals_status.md` and moved to `/home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/gemini-cli/Temp_Projects/servers_forked/Fork_Updates/Solved/`.

**Files to Process:**

To identify the remaining `.md` files, we use the command: `ls -lt /home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/gemini-cli/Temp_Projects/servers_forked/*.md`

Here is the current list of files to process:

*   `/home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/gemini-cli/Temp_Projects/servers_forked/README.md` (Updated)
*   `/home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/gemini-cli/Temp_Projects/servers_forked/sequential_thinking_test_plan_partially_tested.md` (Updated and moved to `Fork_Updates/`)
*   `/home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/gemini-cli/Temp_Projects/servers_forked/pr_comment.md` (Deleted)
*   `/home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/gemini-cli/Temp_Projects/servers_forked/SECURITY.md` (Reviewed, left as is)
*   `/home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/gemini-cli/Temp_Projects/servers_forked/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
*   `/home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/gemini-cli/Temp_Projects/servers_forked/CONTRIBUTING.md`

Remaining files to process:

None. All relevant documentation files have been processed, updated, and organized.
