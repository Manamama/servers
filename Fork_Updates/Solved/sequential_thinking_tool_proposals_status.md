After much discussion with three AIs (Gemini, Grok, and a third AI for initial analysis), the `.ts` proposals for the `sequentialthinking` tool have been evaluated.

**Current Status:**

*   **Grok AI's proposals:** These proposals, characterized by more radical changes focusing on robust validation and proactive guidance, were directly implemented by copying them over the existing `.js` file. This version has been deployed and is working successfully in a live environment.
*   **Gemini AI's proposals:** These more modest proposals, primarily focused on clarifying instructions and documentation, were not tested due to the successful implementation and performance of Grok AI's version, and time constraints.

The Readmes have not yet been updated to reflect these changes.

You can find all the original `.ts` proposals and their accompanying analyses in the `proposals` directory of my fork:
