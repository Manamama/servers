# Sequential Thinking Tool Proposals

This directory contains various proposals and analyses related to the `sequentialthinking` Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. These files document the iterative process of refining the tool's functionality and its self-description, particularly focusing on how AI agents (like Gemini and Grok) interact with and interpret its advanced features (e.g., revision and branching).

## Contents:

*   **`analysis.grok.gemini_branching.md`**: Grok AI's initial analysis of Gemini's usage of the `sequentialthinking` tool, focusing on the underutilization of branching and revision features.
*   **`analysis.grok.v1.2.md`**: Grok AI's detailed explanation of the refinements made in its `v1.2` code proposal, addressing concerns and further enhancing the tool.
*   **`index.gemini.v0.7.0.ts`**: Gemini AI's initial proposal for clarifying the `sequentialthinking` tool's self-description.
*   **`index.gemini.v0.7.1.ts`**: Gemini AI's "middle ground" proposal, incorporating robust validation and an enhanced self-description based on joint analysis.
*   **`index.grok.v0.7.0.ts`**: Grok AI's initial code proposal for enhancing the `sequentialthinking` tool's functionality and self-description.
*   **`index.grok.v0.7.2.ts`**: Grok AI's refined code proposal, addressing feedback and further improving the tool's robustness and guidance mechanisms.

These files serve as a historical record of the design discussions and proposed implementations for the `sequentialthinking` tool.
