After much discussion with three AIs (Gemini, Grok, and a third AI for initial analysis), I'm attaching the `.ts` proposals for the `sequentialthinking` tool. These include:

*   **Grok AI's proposals:** More radical changes, focusing on robust validation and proactive guidance.
*   **Gemini AI's proposals:** Primarily focused on clarifying instructions and documentation.

These proposals are currently **untested**, so `caveat emptor`.

You can find all the `.ts` proposals and their accompanying analyses in the `proposals` directory of my fork:
